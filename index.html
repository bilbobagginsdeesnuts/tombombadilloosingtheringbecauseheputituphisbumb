<h1>Jacks slow decent into loosing his mind
</h1>

<p>Ok so. I’m writing this on my iPad. The time is 6:23pm London time whatever that is, i am sitting in the qantas business lounge surrounded by people talking in Australian accents talking about silver stone, while eating chicken out of a small bowl and drinking my 2nd cocktail. Ive spent much of this day stressing, first about ‘does my bag weigh to much’ (turns out we are both like spot on 29 kg which is under the 30kg limit but like, just? They rounded down which works to my favour) then ‘qantas requires you to link the lounge pass to your flight and its requiring an sms verification but I can’t get it because Optus have decided to not let me Rome” but now im relaxed. We got in, a lovely man at the front desk said “oh the dastardly it” and just waved the problem away. Upon entering i make a b line for the shower and boy howdy do i feel like a king. Sure, it might feel better had i not decided earlier that bringing a change of clothes on the plane would be stupid but i feel like a fuckin king, i had a shower not 2 hours before i get on a 24 hour flight. I’m gonna feel majestic. The trip to Heathrow was also crazy as we were on the tube for an hour. Standing up. The entire time. With two large suitcases and me wearing a backpack that was a target on my back. But we’re here now.Anyway more importantly about that shower. The room was so spacious i was so surprised. It felt like i could’ve swung a cat around in there, However im not sure if i would be able to swing two cats around in there but someone with a shorter stature than i might be able to, however it would not go particularly well i must say as it might not be the most room for such an activity but it was spacious. I now realise it was that size because of people brining in their luggage but i also had a moment of “do i think two people would be able to sneak into this room and have shower sex in the business lounge before boarding a flight”  now do i oft think about the fact that a room is large enough for two people to have sex in whilst in public? No. This is something I’ve literally never thought of before im so confused why I thought of it before now.  Mainly because i was like “no people aren’t fucking in here there were people showing me in they would’ve like. Stopped that. No way in heck they’d let that happen”
</p><p>Anyway its now 6:40 i feel like doctor manhattan and that nun Stanley Yuchi movie trailer keeps playing. I dont know how often im going to be writing this or how much will be published (i may end up editing it or my sleep deprived brain might just hit publish and you all get to enjoy everything I’ve written about or not this is an additional reading)
</p><p>It’s now 6:49 and im realising the plane has no wifi, like i can survive it, i have so much shit downloaded and ready to go but its also just like. No talking to friends? That’s not fun. Anyway ill survive
</p><p>Ok now it’s 6:57 and im listening to the track “Hydrogen” from starlight express (the musical about horny trains). It’s a new song and its a wierd rap about how we gotta not use fossil fuels but also its like a weird bop just in terms of how it opens with “its not a matter of if. It’s a matter of when” but whispered and i almost fully broke out laughing in the lounge and had to stop myself im gonna be listening to this somewhat on loop while im hon the plane i guess. 
</p><p>Also somwrthing i wanna mention is how wierd the news has been while im here. First when we land it was like “farmers are angry over the ides of being taxes when they die” and then that was a lot of protests and the tube being full of farmers which was crazy because i thought one of them was hot but then i took a pic and looked at it later and went “oh what was i thinking” and now its assisted death which is something that’s apparently already legal in Aus and good for us. 
</p><p>It is now 7:54am Sydney time, im on the plane and I’ve immediately changed my watch to being Sydney time so im now like, home! Except im not 13 hours left till Singapore and then its another 8 or so till Sydney so you know. I’m gonna go crazy. What happened since I got on, well im currently listening to the Connector and i adore this soundtrack. Upon getting on the plane it was so fucking hot but i changed into trackless to try and be comfortable and boyuwas it hot (verging on 30 c) but now we’re airborne and flying high. High flying. Ok yet again tho i gotta say how the fuck are people fuckin in plane toilets???? I was so squished in there just trying to change my bloody pants. Oh also there was a flight attendant in front of me who i have to think was gay but god he had an ass anyway gotta stop bein thirsty in here sorry
</p><p>Ok it’s now 8:19 am and I’ve started writing an pub review, this is an idea i had a while ago about someone who goes to review pubs in country England and writes these absolute sprawling peace’s and then the editor begrudgingly cuts it down to the one paragraph the author is allotted in the paper. Also the character is very much Alan partridge in all but name and occupation and the fact that it’s legally destinct get off my back. Also I’ve taken to listening to Be more chill now. Anyway back to writing im already at 800 words and I haven’t even gotten to the meat of the story yet. 
</p><p>Hours have passed, its now 10:39am - i have had another vodka lemonade and it was so fucking strong i think it helped me to confidentially walk down the isle without stumbling it felt powerful and intoxicating. My mum talked to the flight attendant before the flight took off and ended up getting 2 little bottses of wine with water, and also the vodka coke that the flight attendant accidentally made and its very funny to me to have my mum be gettin so drunk. The sandman is calling me tho as its 11:40pm in London and I’ve been on my mums sleep schedule so i now am now breaking out the big guns, the YouTube downloads - which starts with death blast 2024. Also the planes movie selection includes beetle juice beetle juice which is fascinating because that movie contains a plot point of a plane crash im fascinated to see how they handle it. Anyway still like 10 hours left on the flight and im now really realising that an iPad typing experience on the plane rips. Holy shit adhd focus on the fucking sentence, 10 hours left on the flight and im gonna try and stay awake, we land at 6am Sydney time so im like, if i sleep on the 2nd flight then like. That’s somewhat normal sleep? Just gotta get through the delusions. A quarter of the way through death blast and im like, why the fuck didnt i download Paul blast mall cop 2 for the flight. Halfway through and no actually im glad i didnt download it
</p><p>12:50, i plugged my phone into my battery and after a few seconds it turned off and i now think that my phone is fried. I am not even halfway through this flight and i want to cry as i dont know if all my photos were backed up and also just generally i didnt want to have to buy a new phone now? God im so furious but im just fucking trapped sitting here. Thankfully i have my iPod to just play music. I’m swinging now between anger at the battery for doing it and sadness about the phone and no its just anger
</p><p>3:50pm, I have changed to sadness as there was a few pics i took on the plane that are gone - also my phone was just getting weirdly hot? It’s stopped now but i fully think its fried. I do think i managed to calm myself down by watching the game changer ep dont cry which made me cry and also like, re-evaluate it all but idk like all of my google authentications are on there and like photos are backed up but i wouldve liked to have the originals ughk, i just hope the Black Friday sales are still on by the time i land
</p><p>7:44pm, i have been listening to my iPod and slightly napping for i guess since I last wrote - were about 2 hours out of Singapore and im wrecked, the anger at myself for using the big battery pack that i knew was causing me grief instead of the small one that was in the overhead locker and would’ve fried my fucking phone im furious at myself. 
</p><p>8:35pm, were landing and i was just playing world of goo when the fucking plane just started leaking water on me?? The flight attendants in front of me were just like “oh yeah its just the ac” but now im worried that its gonna have fucked my brand bloody new Sony headphones and aaaaaaaaaaa ok plane going down now
</p><p>9:41 pm, sitting in the hallway of Singapore and have wifi, told my brother about the phone with the thing of being like “are there any deals on” and his reaction is “its under warranty” but god do i not want to deal with Harvey Norman. Also turns out that the ANKER battery i thought wasn’t in my little satchel was in there so i bricked my phone out of laziness to not look further i truely hate myself
</p><p>2:21am - sleep is escaping me. Like i have been lying here with headphones on and eye mask and i slept through the takeoff which is something I’ve never done before and also the food which is probs good for me and ok wait the plane took off at like 10pm so maybe I’ve had like 3. Hours sleep but now i just can’t force it. Still four hours left till we land and my iPods in the red and i dont have any music on my iPad and aaaaaa contingencies only work so far ahead. 
</p><p>3:50am - my ip[od has died and so i played a bunch of world of goo, god damn that game has aged. I’m also now having to charge my iPad while i watch monster factory and god this is gonna be a long 2 hours i might give up and watch mars attacks on the screen because they have a Tim burton section for some reason. Also my mums also up so sleep is alluding us all
</p><p>4:52 - Im stinky
</p><p>5:29 - were gettin ready to land, we’ve filled in the custom forums!! Exciting!! I have also had a tea! 
</p>
